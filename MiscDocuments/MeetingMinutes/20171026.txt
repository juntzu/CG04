Meeting# 2
Date: Thursday 26th Oct 2017 11:00
Location: ECIT, Ground Floor Cafe
Attendees: Dr Charles J Gillan, Mr Christopher Brown

Item#1 - Fortran Compiler Issue
---------------------------------

Since the previous meeting, I have had difficulty setting up my local environment to compile Scemama's Fortran code. 
I am using a 4770k Intel processor which has SSE4.2 instruction set. 
The Make file uses iFort (Intel Fortran compiler), Charles suggested that I try using gFortran. 
Suspected problem with $PATH variables, Charles suggested to replace $PATH variable reference to ifort in the Make file with the absolute path to Fortran compiler.
Charles is also going to request me access to the Kelvin cluster at ECIT to compile there.   


Item#2 - Some Additional context
--------------------------------

Dr Gillan has given me some additional context to the differences of C/C++ and Java, specifically relating to data structures I will be using in this project.
- Use of pointers to access a Vector index in (1) time
- Members of Structs are beside eachother in Memory

Suggested to experiment further with pointers.

Also some additional background theory for the Quantum Chemistry and some context to how it relates to bit set operations I will later use.
- Spin orbitals are multiplied by spin up or spin down which giving a Spatial orbital. Up and down spin are represented in bitset matrices. 

Outcomes:
1. Dr Gillan to request access to Kelvin Cluster at ECIT for myself
2. Attempt to compile locally with GFortran
3. Attempt to reference absolute Compiler path in MakeFile
4. Experiment further with c++ pointers.
